# Music Data Analysis
A leading music-catering company is planning to analyse large amount of data received from
varieties of sources, namely mobile app and website to track the behaviour of users, classify users,
calculate royalties associated with the song and make appropriate business strategies. The file server
receives data files periodically after every 3 hours.

### Challenges and Optimisations:
1. LookUp tables are in NoSQL databases. Integrate them with the actual data flow.
2. Try to make joins as less expensive as possible.
3. Data Cleaning, Validation, Enrichment, Analysis and Post Analysis have to be automated. Try
using schedulers.
4. Appropriate logs have to maintained to track the behaviour and overcome failures in the
pipeline.
